## ðŸš€ Programming Roadmap  

I began my journey with **Python**, leveraging its versatility to work with libraries like **pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Flask, and Django** for data analysis, computer vision, and backend development. Iâ€™ve also built GUIs (**Tkinter, Pygame**) and automated web scraping tasks (**BeautifulSoup, Selenium**).  

In **web development**, I work with:  
- **Frameworks**: Next.js, React.js  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind.css), JavaScript (ES6+)  
- **UI Libraries**: Material UI (MUI), Radix UI  
- **Backend**: Django (Python)  
- **Cross-Platform**: Electron for desktop apps, Webintoapps for mobile apps

With **80+ projects on GitHub**, I combine hands-on experience with a commitment to continuous learning.
