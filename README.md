## my professional roadmap ðŸ‘‡

My journey started with Python, a language I fell in love with for its simplicity and versatility. I've dabbled in a bunch of cool libraries like pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, numpy, OpenCV, Tkinter, Pygame, and Flask, using them for data-analysis, building GUIs, computer vision, web-scrapping and building fun games. Feel free to look at my repositories where I have different projects using those libraries.

When it comes to web development, I have experience working with HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap5, Javascript ES6. And let's not forget about Django, where I am experenced working in backend development, building some pretty cool web apps along the way.

Furthuremore, I am familiar to React js and React libraries such as materialUI. I am constantly learning more about this powerfull framework.

- (I am also familliar with technologies such as electron and other techniques to create desktop/mobile application just with HTML,CSS,JS)

With over 70 projects in my github, I am not just all talk. I have got self-experience to back it up. And I am always hungry for more knowledge.
